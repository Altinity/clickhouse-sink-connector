# Spec 10.04: Loud Failure Guarantee & Anti-Swallowing Protocol

## 1. Executive Summary & Purpose
Specifies the non-negotiable policy that unrecoverable replication errors must terminate execution loudly and immediately, strictly prohibiting error swallowing.

---

## 2. Codebase Mapping on 2.11.0
- **System Constitution**: Invariant I9
- **Error Classifier**: `ClickHouseErrorClassifier`

---

## 3. Operational Specification

### 3.1 Anti-Swallowing Rule
Under no circumstances may a worker catch a `SQLException` or `DataConversionException` and simply log a warning while allowing the batch to proceed.
```java
// STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERN:
try {
    ps.executeBatch();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    logger.warn("Batch failed, skipping records: " + e.getMessage()); // VIOLATION!
}
```

### 3.2 Mandatory Crash Contract
When an unrecoverable failure occurs:
1. Roll back the local JDBC transaction.
2. Log full stack trace, binlog coordinates, and table name at `FATAL` level.
3. Throw an unchecked runtime exception to terminate the JVM process or task thread.
4. Leaves `replica_source_info` intact at the last known good commit.

---

## 4. Invariants Preserved
- **Invariant I9 (Loud Failure / Zero Silence)**: Guarantees that data divergence is never masked by silent error suppression.

---

## 5. Verification Criteria
- `ClickHouseBatchRunnableTest.testFatalErrorHaltsExecution()`
