## Adding new tables to configuration.(With Initial Load)
The following steps will guide you through the process of adding newer tables to be replicated 
from Source after the initial replication was setup.
This is achieved using the incremental snapshots feature of debezium
https://debezium.io/blog/2021/10/07/incremental-snapshots/

**Step 1**: Create the `signaling` table in Source using the following schema
```
CREATE TABLE dbz_signal (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
type VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
data VARCHAR(2048) NULL);
```
**Step 2**: Update the `table.include.list` in `config.yml` to include the newer tables and the `signal.data.collection` configuration.
```
table.include.list:"dbname.table1, dbname.table2`
signal.data.collection: "dbname.dbz_signal"
```
Restart the sink connector, either using the `sink-connector-client restart` or by stopping/starting sink connector.

**Step 3**: Insert a new row to the `signaling` table created in Step 1 with the new table information.
```
INSERT INTO dbname.dbz_signal VALUES ('d139b9b7–7777–4547–917d-e1775ea61d61', 'execute-snapshot', '{"data-collections": ["dbname.table1, dbname.table2"]}')
```

This step should trigger the snapshot process in parallel to the regular streaming.

On the sink connector logs, you should notice a new log message that indicates start of `INCREMENTAL` snapshot
```
2024-07-23 13:24:44.040 INFO  - Requested 'INCREMENTAL' snapshot of data collections '[public.tm2]' with additional conditions '[]' and surrogate key 'PK of table will be used'
```

## Capturing Schema changes in Incremental Snapshot

Specifies whether the connector allows schema changes during an incremental snapshot. When the value is set to true, the connector detects schema change during an incremental snapshot, and re-select a current chunk to avoid locking DDLs.

```
incremental.snapshot.allow.schema.changes: true
````


## Adding new tables to configuration.(With Initial Load(Schema only))


**Step 1**: Update the `snapshot.mode` in `config.yml` to `schema_only_recovery`
```
snapshot.mode: "schema_only_recovery"
```
purge the schema history
truncate altinity_sink_connector.replicate_schema_history
restart the sink-connector (docker-compose up)
once replication works fine, you can come back to

snapshot.mode: "schema_only_recovery"
